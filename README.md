## A website for a small local plant nursery.

## Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This site still needs optimization for mobile devices. As I continue to make improvements, I'll be focusing on converting the images to appropriate sizes and webp formats first. I'd also like to finish implementing modal images on the Indoor Plants page and finish adding styling to the table on the Outdoor Plants page to make it more clear which tab is currently selected.

## Lessons Learned:
This site was another exercise in images and how much easier layouts are to create when images have the same dimensions. This was also my first foray into adding functionality to a site with Javascript. I wanted to add a way to filter the table on the Outdoor Plants page so it was easier to read and create image modals on the Indoor Plants page. At the time I was working on these functionalities I only knew pieces of some basic JavaScript, so I had to do quite a lot of googling. I eventually ended up with a table that has different selectable tabs and images that get a little larger when they're hovered over. The modal image function is still in progress.
